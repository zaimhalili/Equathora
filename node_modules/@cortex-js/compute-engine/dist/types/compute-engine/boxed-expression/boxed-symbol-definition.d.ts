/**
 * ### THEORY OF OPERATIONS
 *
 * - The value or type of a constant cannot be changed.
 *
 * - If set explicitly, the value is the source of truth: it overrides any
 *   flags.
 *
 * - Once the type has been set, it can only be changed from a numeric type
 *   to another numeric type (some expressions may have been validated with
 *   assumptions that the just a number).
 *
 * - When the type is changed, the value is preserved if it is compatible
 *   with the new type, otherwise it is reset to no value. Flags are adjusted
 *   to match the type (discarded if not a numeric type).
 *
 * - When the value is changed, the type is unaffected. If the value is not
 *   compatible with the type (setting a def with a numeric type to a value
 *   of `True` for example), the value is discarded.
 *
 * - When getting a flag, if a value is available, it is the source of truth.
 *   Otherwise, the stored flags are (the stored flags are also set when the
 *   type is changed)
