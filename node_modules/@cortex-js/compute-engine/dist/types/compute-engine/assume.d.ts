/**
 * Add an assumption, in the form of a predicate, for example:
 *
 * - `x = 5`
 * - `x ∈ ℕ`
 * - `x > 3`
 * - `x + y = 5`
 *
 * Assumptions that represent a symbol definition (equality to an expression,
 * membership to a type, >0, <=0, etc...) are stored directly in the current
 * scope's symbols dictionary, and an entry for the symbol is created if
 * necessary.
 *
 * Predicates that involve multiple symbols are simplified (for example
 * `x + y = 5` becomes `x + y - 5 = 0`), then stored in the `assumptions`
 * record of the current context.
 *
 * New assumptions can 'refine' previous assumptions, if they don't contradict
 * previous assumptions.
 *
 * To set new assumptions that contradict previous ones, you must first
 * `forget` about any symbols in the new assumption.
