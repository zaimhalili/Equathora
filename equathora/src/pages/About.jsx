                                    Equathora was born from a simple observation: <em>students often struggle with math not because
                                        they lack ability, but because traditional learning methods don't align with how they think</em>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We noticed that when mathematics is presented as isolated formulas and disconnected problems,
                                    learners lose sight of the bigger picture. That's why we created Equathora—a platform that
                                    combines:
                                </p>
